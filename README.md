## Philosophy
This is **not a traditional desktop** in any sense. It is highly opinionated, consists of what works for me and looks good for me and frequently disregards traditional desktop conventions and expectations. It has been evolving for about 8 years, spanning across several window managers and a migration from X11 to Wayland.

This desktop is:
- Mouse-friendly but keyboard-loving, particularly when it comes to Vi keys
- Dark and cozy, with vibrant colors and a sprinkle of kawaii-ness
